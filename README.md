# PlanIt

PlanIt is a responsive scheduling app where you can create, edit, and delete apps. The app starts with sign up page to create the user. The events created by a user are unique to them. The app has a side navbar with a glassy look with easy access to other pages.

## Next Steps

Future Plans for this app is to add a completed task section allowing users to mark which tasks have been completed rather than just deleting them. 
I would also like to add a feature that makes task have different levels of priority. So one task can be marked as important where others would be less of a priority.
Lastly I would love to add a feature where users would be able to share their tasks with one another. Like group tasks.
